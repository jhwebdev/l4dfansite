			<div class="items"> The common infected is one of the basic classes of infected, although not very strong individually; large numbers of them can overwhelm the survivors. When they are all grouped up together in large numbers they are called "The Horde". The Horde can only be encountered during "crescendo" moments and through loud noises. When they are attracted there will be a warning and a horde of zombies will come your way.</div>

			<div class="items"> The Smoker is randomly spawned throughout the campaign and most of the time can be found in high places. The Smoker is a special type of infected that has multiple tongues sticking out of its body. The Smoker is able to shoot its tongue onto a survivor and grapple them towards him. At that point it will then strangle the survivors while other infected damage the survivor. The only way to escape it is to cut off its tongue before it gets you or have a teammate either cut its tongue or shoot it. When it is killed it will release smoke and blur your vision.

			<div class="items"> The Boomer is a fat type of special infected that spawns randomly throughout a campaign. The Boomer has the special ability to attract The Horde. It can puke out its green vomit which can drench a/multiple survivor(s) and obscure their vision with its green vomit and attract The Horde to the survivor(s). But, there's another reason why you should stay away from it; when it's killed it will blow up and damage you, while its explosion will drench anyone in its radius in its green vomit.

			<div class="items"> The Hunter is a special type of infected that usually lingers around high places. It wears a hoodie covering its face obscuring the upper part of his face. The Hunter has the ability to "pounce" on a survivor. When it is successful in doing so, it will then be able to "gut out" a survivor until he/she dies. To prevent this you can knock it back during its "pounce" or have a teammate kill it while you're being pinned by it.

			<div class="items">The Tank is the ultimate type of special infected; superior to anyone else. The Tank can only spawn during scripted moments. The Tank has highest amount of health and does the most amount of damage. It has the ability to throw cars, pick up conrete and throw it. On top of that, if you are hit with either of those you will instantly be incapacitated. Another thing is that its punches are able to knock you back. Its greatest weakness however is fire; a molotov or any source of fire will hurt The Tank a great deal and will keep burning on the tank until it dies.

			<div class="items">The Witch is a unique type of special infected able to make a crying sound that sounds like a real human. It is a slender, gray-skinned woman with long gray hair and sharp, long claws for both of its hands. It is usually a passive type of infected only attacking if provoked. When you hear its crying sounds it is nearby. Shining a flashlight onto it, making loud noises, and moving close to it will provoke her. When she is provoked she will run to the survivor who startled her. At that point it will "gut out" the survivor who startled her only. A warning will pop up when she is startled and who did it. She can do a lot of damage and is fairly quick while running; however she does not have a lot of health.
